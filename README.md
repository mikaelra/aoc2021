# Solutions for Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code is a Christmas calender where you get two code puzzles every day which you can solve.
Some solutions for them can be found here.

Sometimes the code is incomplete because I get enough information computed and do the rest on a local calculator.

Most solutions are in python, but I will try to use FSharp as well.
